# CreativityProject
A study of Creative Search Strategies: Examining Yuval Hartâ€™s project on the same subject (Hart's used an abstract experiment taken on a computer), I decided on having a physical take, using plasticine and recording videos of the tester's faces and hands. Later on targeting ways of Machine-Learning their gestures to find their strategy for getting new ideas.

This repository is the part responsible for reading tester's facial expressions.
The project itself studies what can be learnt by ML to help conclude regarding Creative Search Strategies studies.
